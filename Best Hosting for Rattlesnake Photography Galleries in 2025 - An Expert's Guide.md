It also includes features like one-click WordPress installation and free SSL certificates.

### Performance and Speed
Scala Hosting's servers are optimized for speed and performance, using SSD storage and LiteSpeed web servers. This combination ensures your rattlesnake photography galleries load quickly, providing a smooth and engaging experience for your visitors. Fast loading times are critical for keeping users on your site and improving your search engine rankings.

### Pricing
