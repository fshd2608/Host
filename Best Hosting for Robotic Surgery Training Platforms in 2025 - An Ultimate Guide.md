This is crucial for robotic surgery training platforms that might involve heavy graphics, video simulations, and real-time interaction. Faster loading times lead to better user experience, especially when dealing with intricate surgical procedures.

### Security Features:
Security is paramount when handling sensitive medical data. Scala Hosting offers real-time malware protection, automated backups, and a dedicated firewall. They proactively monitor servers for potential threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring a secure training environment.

### Scalability:
As your robotic surgery training platform grows, you might need more resources. Scala Hosting's VPS solutions are easily scalable, allowing you to increase CPU, RAM, and storage as required. This flexibility ensures that your platform can handle increased traffic and data without any performance degradation.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans start at around $14.95/month for entry-level configurations. For a more robust platform, their higher-tier plans offer more resources and advanced features, generally ranging up to $100+/month depending on your specific needs.
