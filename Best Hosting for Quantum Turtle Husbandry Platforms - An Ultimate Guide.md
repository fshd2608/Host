They offer free SSL certificates to encrypt data transmitted between your website and visitors, safeguarding sensitive information. They also utilize a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic and prevent unauthorized access to your server. Additionally, Scala Hosting performs regular malware scans and offers automatic backups to ensure data integrity and availability.

### Scalability Options:
As your quantum turtle husbandry platform grows, Scala Hosting allows you to easily scale your resources to accommodate increased traffic and computational demands. You can upgrade your VPS plan to add more CPU cores, RAM, and storage space as needed. This ensures that your website remains responsive and performs optimally even during peak periods.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting offers a range of VPS plans suitable for different needs and budgets. Their managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month for basic configurations, while more advanced plans with higher resource allocations can cost upwards of $100 per month.
